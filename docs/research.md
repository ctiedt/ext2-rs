## Getting started with file system drivers in Linux
- [Experiments with writing a filesystem driver for Linux:](https://www.uninformativ.de/blog/postings/2017-09-09/0/POSTING-en.html)
I managed to load the example file system onefilerofs into the kernel \(I think\).
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get oneblockfs to work yet.
This is what I did \(with help from [this](https://kukuruku.co/post/writing-a-file-system-in-linux-kernel/)\):
    - `make`
    - `sudo insmod .\onefilerofs.ko`
    - `touch image`: this creates an \(empty\) disk image; I'm still unsure what I would have to do if this wasn't just an example
    - `mkdir dir`: this is the root of the file system
    - `sudo mount -o loop -t onefilerofs ./image ./dir`
    - to unmount: 
        - `sudo umount ./dir`
        - `sudo rmmod onefilerofs`
